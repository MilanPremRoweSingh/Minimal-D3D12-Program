# Minimal-D3D12-Program
Minimal D3D12 program created while learning D3D12. 

Created while following [3D Game Engine Programming's DX12 lessons](https://www.3dgep.com/category/graphics-programming/directx/). Majority of the code is identical, but each line (which merits it) has been commented as part of the learning process (and for future reference).
